Linux means the kernel of the system, which is the central controller of everything that happens on the computer. When most people refer to Linux, they are really referring to a combination of software called GNU/Linux , which defines the operating system. GNU is the free software that provides open source equivalents of many common UNIX commands. The Linux part of this combination is the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system. 1.3 Linux is Open Source. The open source philosophy is that you have a right to obtain the software source code and to modify it for your own use. Linux adopted this philosophy to great success. Linus made the source programming code (the instructions a computer uses to operate) freely available. 1.4 Linux Has Distributions. Take Linux and the GNU tools, add some user-facing applications like a web browser and an email client, and you have a full Linux system. Individuals and even companies started bundling all this software into distributions almost as soon as Linux became usable. There are distributions that focus on running servers, desktops, or even industry-specific tools such as electronics design or statistical computing. The major players in the market can be traced back to either Red Hat, Debian or Slackware. 1.5 Linux Embraces the CLI. Typically operating systems offer both GUI and CLI interfaces. However, most consumer operating systems (Windows, macOS) are designed to shield the user from the complexity of the CLI. The Linux community is different in that it positively celebrates the CLI for its power, speed and ability to accomplish a vast array of tasks with a single command line instruction.","title":"Module 1"},{"location":"module1/#module-1-introduction-to-linux","text":"","title":"Module 1 Introduction to Linux"},{"location":"module1/#11-linux-is-everywhere","text":"","title":"1.1 Linux is Everywhere."},{"location":"module1/#12-linux-is-a-kernel","text":"Linux means the kernel of the system, which is the central controller of everything that happens on the computer.
